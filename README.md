<h2>User Stories</h2>
<ol>
  <li>I can add bookmarks to my bookmark list. Bookmarks contain:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Title</li>  
        <li>url link</li>
        <li>Description</li>
        <li>rating (1-5)</li>
      </ul>
  <li>I can see a list of my bookmarks when I first open the app</li>
  <li> All bookmarks in the list default to a "condensed" view showing only title and rating</li>
  <li>I can click on a bookmark to display the "detailed" view - (can probably be achieved by using css display none until button clicked and class is changed to allow user to see content)</li>
  <li>Detailed view expands to additionally display description and a "Visit Site" link</li>
  <li>I can remove bookmarks from my bookmark list</li> 
  <li>I receive appropriate feedback when I cannot submit a bookmark. </li>
        Check all validations in the API documentation (e.g. title and url field required)</li>
  <li>I can select from a dropdown (a <select> element) a "minimum rating" to filter the list by all bookmarks rated at or above the chosen selection</li>
  <li>(Extension feature - optional) I can edit the rating and description of a bookmark in my list</li>
</ol>
